# Human Resource Database Management System

I made this project when we were instructed to develop a project on DBMS, to give it a good package of usability this project was built with technologies like HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, SQL, MySQL, PHP. The scope of the project is clear to give a simple and attractive application to simplify the work as well as to reduce the efforts while doing it offline or we can say by doing it with old methods.
In this application, we can save the database of all products present on the site. In this application, we can manage any employee very easily.


## Overview
This document discusses the result of the work done in the development of HR DBMS. HTML and CSS as the Front-end Platform and MySQL as the back-end Platform. In the development of an application, PHP provides a good connecting facility between all pages, also the back-end MySQL is most important to save all the data related to the application.
## Methodology
To implement the above goals, the following methodology needs to be followed:
1. Specifying forms for easy addition and deletion of faculties for the admin.
2. Specify the bindings between the tasks and the resources either manually or by the design tools.
3. Specifying the port interconnections between the resources.
